  abstract = {In most microarray technologies, a number of critical steps are required
	to convert raw intensity measurements into the data relied upon by
	data analysts, biologists, and clinicians. These data manipulations,
	referred to as preprocessing, can influence the quality of the ultimate
	measurements. In the last few years, the high-throughput measurement
	of gene expression is the most popular application of microarray
	technology. For this application, various groups have demonstrated
	that the use of modern statistical methodology can substantially
	improve accuracy and precision of the gene expression measurements,
	relative to ad hoc procedures introduced by designers and manufacturers
	of the technology. Currently, other applications of microarrays are
	becoming more and more popular. In this paper, we describe a preprocessing
	methodology for a technology designed for the identification of DNA
	sequence variants in specific genes or regions of the human genome
	that are associated with phenotypes of interest such as disease.
	In particular, we describe a methodology useful for preprocessing
	Affymetrix single-nucleotide polymorphism chips and obtaining genotype
	calls with the preprocessed data. We demonstrate how our procedure
	improves existing approaches using data from 3 relatively large studies
	including the one in which large numbers of independent calls are
	available. The proposed methods are implemented in the package oligo
	available from Bioconductor.},

  abstract = {High-density single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays (SNP chips)
	provide information on a subject's genome, such as copy number and
	genotype (heterozygosity/homozygosity) at a SNP. While fluorescence
	in situ hybridization and karyotyping reveal many abnormalities,
	SNP chips provide a higher resolution map of the human genome that
	can be used to detect, e.g., aneuploidies, microdeletions, microduplications
	and loss of heterozygosity (LOH). As a variety of diseases are linked
	to such chromosomal abnormalities, SNP chips promise new insights
	for these diseases by aiding in the discovery of such regions, and
	may suggest targets for intervention. The R package SNPchip contains
	classes and methods useful for storing, visualizing and analyzing
	high density SNP data. Originally developed from the SNPscan web-tool,
	SNPchip utilizes S4 classes and extends other open source R tools
	available at Bioconductor. This has numerous advantages, including
	the ability to build statistical models for SNP-level data that operate
	on instances of the class, and to communicate with other R packages
	that add additional functionality. AVAILABILITY: The package is available
	from the Bioconductor web page at www.bioconductor.org. SUPPLEMENTARY

	PennCNV, a hidden Markov model (HMM) based approach, for kilobase-resolution
	detection of CNVs from Illumina high-density SNP genotyping data.
	This algorithm incorporates multiple sources of information, including
	total signal intensity and allelic intensity ratio at each SNP marker,
	the distance between neighboring SNPs, the allele frequency of SNPs,
	and the pedigree information where available. We applied PennCNV
	to genotyping data generated for 112 HapMap individuals; on average,
	we detected approximately 27 CNVs for each individual with a median
	size of approximately 12 kb. Excluding common rearrangements in lymphoblastoid
	cell lines, the fraction of CNVs in offspring not detected in parents
	(CNV-NDPs) was 3.3\%. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of
	whole-genome fine-mapping of CNVs via high-density SNP genotyping.},

  abstract = {Array-based technologies have been used to detect chromosomal copy
	number changes (aneuploidies) in the human genome. Recent studies
	identified numerous copy number variants (CNV) and some are common
	polymorphisms that may contribute to disease susceptibility. We developed,
	and experimentally validated, a novel computational framework (QuantiSNP)
	for detecting regions of copy number variation from BeadArray SNP
	genotyping data using an Objective Bayes Hidden-Markov Model (OB-HMM).
	Objective Bayes measures are used to set certain hyperparameters
	in the priors using a novel re-sampling framework to calibrate the
	model to a fixed Type I (false positive) error rate. Other parameters
	are set via maximum marginal likelihood to prior training data of
	known structure. QuantiSNP provides probabilistic quantification
	of state classifications and significantly improves the accuracy
	of segmental aneuploidy identification and mapping, relative to existing
	analytical tools (Beadstudio, Illumina), as demonstrated by validation
	of breakpoint boundaries. QuantiSNP identified both novel and validated
	CNVs. QuantiSNP was developed using BeadArray SNP data but it can
	be adapted to other platforms and we believe that the OB-HMM framework
	has widespread applicability in genomic research. In conclusion,
	QuantiSNP is a novel algorithm for high-resolution CNV/aneuploidy
	detection with application to clinical genetics, cancer and disease
	association studies.},
